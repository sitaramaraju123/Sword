Actually i created my own server to store the user data by using json server
when the user was registed the data will be push to db.json and it will show in the userlist component

---To start application---
You have to install node modules for Sword File
after that check weather the server was working are not by using 'cd server/npm start'
and then main sword file by using 'cd Sword/npm start'
